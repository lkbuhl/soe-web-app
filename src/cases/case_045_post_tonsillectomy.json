  "vignette": "The patient is a 10-year-old male with a history of diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (apneaâ€“hypopnea index [AHI] of 27) who presents to the emergency department with bleeding in the posterior oropharynx 7 days post-tonsillectomy. On physical exam, the patient is lethargic with pallor and decreased capillary refill. His vital signs are significant for tachycardia to 140 beats per minute, hypotension with blood pressure of 70/40 mmHg, and tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient is accompanied by his mother, who states that the bleeding started 2 hours ago after the child ate a sandwich.",
